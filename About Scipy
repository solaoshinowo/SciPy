SciPy, pronounced as Sigh Pi, is a scientific python open source, distributed under the BSD
licensed library to perform Mathematical, Scientific and Engineering Computations.
The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional
array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays and provides
many user-friendly and efficient numerical practices such as routines for numerical
integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are
quick to install and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful
enough to depend on by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.


Data Structure
The basic data structure used by SciPy is a multidimensional array provided by the NumPy
module. NumPy provides some functions for Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms and
Random Number Generation, but not with the generality of the equivalent functions in Scipy


Below are Scipy's sub packages
SciPy is organized into sub-packages covering different scientific computing domains. 

These are summarized in the below:
scipy.cluster used for Vector quantization / Kmeans
scipy.constants used for Physical and mathematical constants
scipy.fftpack used for Fourier transform
scipy.integrate used for Integration routines
scipy.interpolate used for Interpolation
scipy.io  used for Data input and output
scipy.linalg used for Linear algebra routines
scipy.ndimage used for n-dimensional image package
scipy.odr used for Orthogonal distance regression
scipy.optimize used for Optimization
scipy.signal used for Signal processing
scipy.sparse used for Sparse matrices

in subsequent files, i will demonstrate the uses of the sub packages
